Prodigy Data Science Internship Task-2

**Task-02:Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.**

Sample Dataset :- https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data

***Note: It's not compulsory to use the provided dataset. Additionally, Data Science Interns can use tools like MS Excel, Power BI, Tableau & Google Sheets too.***
Here is my proposed solution for the Prodigy visualization task using Tableau:

1.**Data Cleaning**:I performed data cleaning in Excel and Tableau. In Excel, for the Age column, I calculated the mean (23.7), median (22), and mode (24), replacing the missing values with the mode. Similarly, for the Cabin column, I identified the most frequent cabins, and since two cabins had the highest frequency, I replaced the missing values with one of those highly frequent values. In Tableau, I addressed the Embarked column, which had a single null value

2.**Exploratory Data Analysis**:The exploratory data analysis includes univariate visualizations, bi-variate visualizations, and outlier detection visualization using boxplots. I utilized histograms, scatterplots,boxplots and heat maps to visualize relationships between variables.

3.**Patterns and Trends**:To detect patterns and trends, I created a Tableau dashboard.

***You can also view my excel dataset with no null values in this repository***
